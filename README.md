 Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome
 - I had challenges with the responsive design of the about me page.  The image was distorted at certain screen sizes.  I was able to solve for this by using bootstrap.  I applied an img-fluid class to the image at the set the amount of grid space that the image and text content would take up at various screens sizes. 
 - I also had changes with the resume modal, which would display briefly then close.  I reviewed all my Javascript code as well as the modal example from class but wasn't able to find the issue.  Eventually, I figured out that there was an issue with how I set up my anchor tag in the HTML file.  I didn't include anything in the href, so the page was refreshing when I clicked the link the page was refreshing. I added a # to the anchor tag which resolved the issue.
